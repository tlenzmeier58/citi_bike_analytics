# Obeservations

## I have selected three months from three recent years -- 2022, 2021, & 2020. I selected the month of June since that most likely would have been one of the more active months.

### 1. Year over year growth from 2020 to 2022 was substantial. The number of rides increase 93% and 67% respectively.
### 1. The number of E-Bikes has been steadily increasing since 2020; particularly from 2021 to 2022.
### 1. The number of subscribers has steadily increase from 2020. 
### 1. From 2020 to 2021, Wednesday was the most popular day of the week to go for a ride.
### 1. The top 10 ride start stations are in close proximity to mass transit stations. Why  not bike instead of a cab!
### 1. The average ride distance from the top 10 stations is less than a mile; which suggests that riders are commuting short distances.
